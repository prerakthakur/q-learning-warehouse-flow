# q-learning-warehouse-flow

This is a progam to optimize the autonomous robot path within a warehouse. The autonomous robot should go from a starting zone to target zone using the most optimal path and considering other priority zones on the way.

Each zone in the warehouse is labeled as shown above. A robot has to find the optimal path to go from a starting zone to target zone. 
Example - For going from zone L to F, the robot should take the path 
_[L,K,J,F]_ instead of _[L,H,G,C,B,F]_
